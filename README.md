# Tic_Tac_Toe
This Tic Tac Toe game is coded using Pygame. The game board consists of a 3X3 grid of cells. The player with 'X' starts by selecting a position, followed by the player with 'O'. The game ends when a player gets three in a row, column, or diagonal. If all nine positions are filled without a winner, the game is a tie.
